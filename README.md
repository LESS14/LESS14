# Um pouco sobre mim (a little about me)
Hi there, my name is Felipe Maciel, and I'm a Brazilian-born software architect. I'm always willing to contribute to open source projects that interest me.

I have many hobbies and frequently shift my focus between them and various hobby projects. Currently, I am working on a side project to create an RPG-based open.mp server with modern features that blend both classical and contemporary RPG elements. I've been developing this project with a group of friends for about five months, but it has become more serious in the last three months. It's now on bit of a hiatus due to some significant life changes I'm going through.
